    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sauerbraten is a traditional German roast of heavily marinated meat. 
        It is regarded as a national dish of Germany, and is frequently served 
        in German-style restaurants internationally. It can be prepared from a 
        variety of meats, most often from beef, but also from venison, lamb and 
        mutton, pork and horse. Before cooking, the raw meat is marinated for 
        three to ten days in a mixture of vinegar or wine, water, herbs, spices, 
        and seasonings. Usually, tougher cuts of meat, such as rump roast or 
        bottom round of beef, are used, and the long marinating tenderizes the 
        meat. A Sauerbraten dinner is almost always accompanied by a hearty 
        gravy resulting from its roasting and is most often served with potato 
        pancakes (Kartoffelpuffer), potato dumplings (Kartoffelklöße), or 
        Spätzle.</p>

    <p>Ingredients used in the marinade, and accompaniments served with 
        sauerbraten, vary across regions. Regional variants of the dish include 
        those from Baden, Franconia, Thuringia, Rhineland, Saarland, Silesia, 
        and Swabia.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds beef rump roast</li>
        <li>2 large onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine vinegar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>10 whole cloves, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>10 gingersnap cookies, crumbled</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Place beef rump roast, onions, vinegar, water, 1 tablespoon salt, 
            1 tablespoon black pepper, sugar, cloves, and bay leaves in a large 
            pot. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 days, turning meat daily. 
            Remove meat from marinade and pat dry with paper towels, reserving 
            marinade.</li>
        <li>Season flour to taste with salt and black pepper in a large bowl. 
            Sprinkle flour mixture over beef.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat; 
            cook beef until brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Pour reserved 
            marinade over beef, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer 
            until beef is tender, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Remove beef to a platter 
            and slice.</li>
        <li>Strain solids from remaining liquid and continue cooking over 
            medium heat. Add gingersnap cookies and simmer until gravy is 
            thickened, about 10 minutes. Serve gravy over sliced beef.</li>
